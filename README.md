In this project, I analyzed three months of fulfillment and sales data totaling 2,400 transactions for an e-commerce clothing business. I evaluated order activity, product performance, customer satisfaction, and delivery efficiency to uncover operational insights. Using SQL, data modeling, and DAX, I developed a dynamic dashboard that visualizes key performance indicators and supports leadership decision-making across product strategy, customer experience, and fulfillment operations.
